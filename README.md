# Notes API
RESTful API for [Notes](https://github.com/DarkSideOfTheCode/notes)

## Inspiration
Google, Apple, and all the big companies know too much about us already. Having sensible information in someone else's computer is not such a good idea. This project allows to have all your notes in your own server (or computer).
